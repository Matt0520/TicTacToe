## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is a software version of the infamous game of TicTacToe,

Setup:

1. Copy and paste the code of style.css, index.html, and script.js into your Visual Studio Code from your PC.
2. Once done, open the index file by your default browser.
3. Upon opening, you're greeted to the game itself. Enjoy!

Rules:
1. Before the game starts, both players must decide which of them goes first. Whoever goes first, can decide what variable are they willing to pick (either X or O).
2. Once decided, the game's goal is simple: hoever make a diagonal, vertical and horizontal set of characters within the 3x3 container wins.
3. Once the game decided its winner, both players can decide if they want to restart the game. However, whoever won from the previous game, gets their sccore shown on the screen.

Design:

The game's theme is a fog of war, it showcases the vision of both players on where there are no containers with a variable yet. Similar with sinking ships, but players can see where the characters are placed.
The player's container also lits up whenever it's their turn, indicating which player is going first. Once the game is finished, the light becomes green, showcasing which player won that game.
